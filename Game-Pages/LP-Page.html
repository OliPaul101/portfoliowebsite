        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            Llama Party is my final project for year 3 for my BSc Games Development course at Norwich University of the Arts. Inspired by card games such as Hearthstone, Marvel Snaps and
            Gwent. Llama Party is my take on the card game genre. Using AI generated art for the card art and machine learning agents for the opponent AI, this game is truly the AI passion project of my dreams.
            The goal of Llama Party is quite simple, you must accumulate the most Llama Points to win. To accumulate these points you must play cards. Cards however can be destroyed, headbutt, yelled at, etc.

                        <h5>The Story</h5>
                        <p>
                            Yes that's right! There is a small story in Llama Party, mostly so it's a a bit easier to structure the game and levels.
                            The story in Llama Party is that you are a Llama in prison and you make a deal with a Demon to escape. But your escape is stopped by The Warden (the first opponent in the tutorial level)
                            After the escape, The Demon has plans of their own.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Tutorial Level</h5>
                        <p>
                            The first level of the game is when you escape from prison and are faced up against The Warden. This is the tutorial level.
                            The tutorial level serves as an easing into the game and allows the player to grasp the core mechanics of Llama Party.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To help explain the mechanics, The Demon has it's own dialogue box and gives hints and tips on how to play the game.
                        </p>

                        <img src="../Images/LlamaParty-Images/Tutorial1-Image.png" style="margin-bottom:25px;" />
                        <p>
                            The Demon starts the level off by explaining that the player has made a deal with them to escape prison. The Demon then
                            gives the player their deck to face off against The Warden.
                        </p>

                        <img src="../Images/LlamaParty-Images/Tutorial2-Image.png" style="margin-bottom:25px;" />
                        <p>
                            Once the player takes the deck of cards from The Demon. The battle starts and The Demon tells the player how to play the game along
                            with some hints and tips.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I'm glad I took the time to implement this as it makes the game a lot easier to pick up and play.

                </div>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h5>Player Hand System</h5>
                        <img src="../Images/LlamaParty-Images/LlamaParty-Codesnippets/DrawCode-Snippet.png" style="margin-bottom:25px;" />
                        <p>
                            The code above is from DrawSystem.cs and allows the player to draw up to three cards at the start of every turn.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It firstly checks to see if the deck has more than one card; then it picks a random card from 0 to the maximum size of the deck list; then a for
                            loop going through each availabe space in the players hand. If it finds a space, then it set actives, or draws, the card into that space
                            in the players hand.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Board System</h5>
                        <p>
                            The board system controls the pieces on the board after the player plays a card from their hand. Once the player plays a
                            card from their hand, a 3D board 'piece' is played onto the board representing that card.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../Images/LlamaParty-Images/LlamaParty-Codesnippets/BoardSystem-Snippet.png" style="margin-bottom:25px;" />
                        <p>
                            The board system uses an array of Transforms and Bools, literally. The Transform array 'boardSlots' is so I can edit the position of where these
                            pieces get played in the level. The Bool array 'availableBoardSlots' is to keep track of which boardSlots have a card piece.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The code for the board system is quite simple. It goes through which board slots are available, using a for loop. Then if one is true, i.e. available, then
                            it will instantiate (spawn) a card piece there at the location of the Transform but will also make it a child object of the Transform gameobject.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Card Hand Script</h5>
                        <img src="../Images/LlamaParty-Images/LlamaParty-Codesnippets/CardHand-OnPointerUp-Snippet.png" style="margin-bottom:25px;" />
                        <p>
                            The 'Card Hand Script' is the script that the card in the players hand has. This script controls playing its represented piece onto the board
                            if the player wants to play that card. Before being played, the card checks to see if the current amount of Llama Orbs (the cost to play a card)
                            is enough and if the player side is available (i.e. check to see if the players side is already full). If both are true then the card gets played and then
                            gets discarded.
                        </p>

                        <img src="../Images/LlamaParty-Images/LlamaParty-Codesnippets/endplayerTurn-BattleSystem-Snippet.png" style="margin-bottom:25px;" />

                        <p>
                            In the Battle System script, when the player ends their turn. A for loop goes through all the availableBoardSlots that have
                            a card on them, basically the opposite to what the playCard function does as that checks for all availableBoardSlots that do not
                            have cards on them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If it finds a board slot that has a card on it, then it checks to see if that card has the 'CardHeadButt' script component attached to
                            it. If it does then it executes a function on that gameobject from that script called 'attackPlayer'.
                        </p>

                        <img src="../Images/LlamaParty-Images/LlamaParty-Codesnippets/CardHeadbutt-attackPlayer-Snippet.png" style="margin-bottom:25px;" />
                        <p>
                            The attackPlayer function is what you'd expect it to be, in that it attacks the opposing player after the other player has activated it.
                            It checks to see if headButt has been activated, if activated then checks to see if this a player 1 card or a player 2 card, so that points
                            can be added or taken away accordingly. Then the piece on the board is raised up, just so the player can have some visualisation of what is happening.
                            Then canCharge is set to true.
                        </p>

                        <img src="../Images/LlamaParty-Images/LlamaParty-Codesnippets/Update-canCharge-Snippet.png" style="margin-bottom:25px;" />
                        <p>
                            If canCharge is true then the piece flies towards the opposing players portrait and destroys itself and takes away the points in the process. I will be
                            adding some particle effects for this as well when the piece destroys itself for more visual feedback and fun.

                        <p>
                            Using an enum to track whose turn is whose and to see if the player has lost or won, the 'BattleSystem' controls the entire flow of the game
                            It also keeps track of the number of turns and executes a simple AI for testing.
                        </p>

                        <img src="../Images/Code-Snippets/LPBattleState2-Snippet.png" style="width:50%; height:auto;" />

                        <p>
                            IEnumerators allow me to further control the flow of the game as the game can say what turn is starting, then wait 2 seconds, the start the players turn.
                            At the start of the players turn, the BattleState script calls functions from the 'orbSystem' and the 'drawSystem'. The orbSystem is called to reset the
                            players orbs back up to the maximum which is 3 and the draw system is used to draw cards.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once the player ends their turn, a coroutine then starts the enemy's turn and the BattleState script executes the simple AI
                            I programmed that only plays one card as I am still testing the cards mechanics. After the basic AI has played its card, it ends its turn
                            and starts the players turn again at the beginning of turn 2.
